Description: Can be used for optimal transport between two-dimensional grids with respect to separable cost functions of l^p form. It utilizes the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to approximate so-called pivot measures: one-dimensional transport plans that fully describe the full transport, see G. Auricchio (2021) <arXiv:2105.07278>. For these, it offers methods for visualization and to extract the corresponding transport plans and costs. Additionally, related functions for one-dimensional optimal transport are available.
